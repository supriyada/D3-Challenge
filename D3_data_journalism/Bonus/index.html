          <h4>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and other factors</h4>
          <p>The graph reveals the visual outcome of impact of various factors like 
            poverty, income, age, obesity and somking influencing healthcare in all 51 states in U.S. 
            
            <p><strong>Poverty Vs Healthcare:</strong>With the increase in the rate of poverty, the rate of lack in healthcare also increases.
               The maximum poverty rate is observed at 21.5% in state, Missisipi. The 
            minimum poverty rate is observed at 9.2% in state, New Hampshire.Similarly, Texas has the highest rate of lack in healthcare at 24.9% and Massachusetts at 4.6% enjoys most from 
            healthcare benefits.</p>
          <p><strong>Income Vs Healthcare:</strong>As the median value of the household income decreases we could see an increase in
            the lack of healthcare. Maryland has the median income of $73,791, being the highest and Missisipi with median income of $39,680 which 
            is the lowest. We also observed Missisipi has the highest poverty rate. Less income leads to poverty and thereby people are struggling
            to get proper healthcare.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Age Vs Obesity/Smokers:</strong> The rate of obesity & smokers in most of the states falls within the age range between 32 and 42 years.
          Utah has the obesity rate as low as 25.7% which is minimum as compared to Maine with rate 28.2% which is maximum. The same 
        pattern is observed with smokers rate as well. Utah has the smokers rate as low as 9.7% which is minimum as compared to Maine with rate 19.3% 
        which is maximum </p>
          <p>The factors are all interrelated in some way or other and are found to be 
            influencing the health of the individuals in the country!</p>
